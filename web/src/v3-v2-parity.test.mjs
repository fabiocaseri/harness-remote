/**
 * What 3.0 kept from the 2.x shell, and what it quietly dropped.
 *
 * `App.tsx` and its components (`session-composer`, `session-list`, `panels`, `shell`) are the 2.x
 * tree. Nothing in the running app imports them any more, so a capability that lived only there
 * disappeared from the product without any single change ever looking like a removal. This file is
 * the audit made executable: each restored capability gets a guard, so it cannot be lost a second
 * time by the same route.
 *
 * Prompt image attachments are restored on the active Session-first path. The live harness
 * capability gates the paperclip, the shared v3 composer prepares the same bounded images as 2.x,
 * and the native Session operation carries them through the daemon without routing them through the
 * retired Task launch pipeline.
